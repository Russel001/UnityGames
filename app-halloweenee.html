<br><br>
The Creator (Joseph Russel Timpug Ison) of the Application ('Halloweenee') respects the privacy of the Users (You) of this Application (also known as an 'App'). All User data generated by the Application which are only game scores and variables only resides within the memory of the User's mobile whether or not it is connected to an internet connection.

What is Halloweenee?
</b>
</font>
</p>
<font color="black">        
<br>
It is a fun game where our friendly little Witch Halloweenee gains points by touching the Magical Couldrons while avoiding the other Halloween characters such as a Peek-A-Boo Vampire, a Grouchy Werewolf, a Zombie Boy, a Friendly Ghost, and a Funny Pumpkin. 
<br><br>
Halloweena moves forward and when the Player taps the screen Halloweena moves to the left otherwise she moves to the right.
<br><br>
Everytime Halloweena touches the Magic Couldrons she earns a point and turns to a Green color. But she loses points and loses color when she touches a Ghost or a Pumpkin. She even loses more points when she touches a Vampire, Werewolf or Zombie.
<br><br>
When her score reaches zero (0) she loses the game.
<br><br>
Take note that the more points the Player collects the higher is the likelihood that the Player would play the game longer because she has more points to spare in case she loses points.
<br><br>
The Player can adjust the sound volume of the background music and the sound effects by adjusting the volume sliders (colored Red and White) located at the bottom of the screen.
<br><br>
The Current Points and the All Around High Score (colored Yellow) is displayed on top of the screen.
<br><br>
The Menu/Restart button opens up the Menu Screen with the following three (3) buttons:
<br><br>
1. Title Image Button- Displays a fullblown art image of Halloweenee. The heroine of the game.
<br><br>
2. High Scores Button- Displays the ten (10) Highest Scores in the game.
<br><br>
3. Restart Button- Restarts the game.
<br><br>
Everytime the Player exceeds one of the ten (10) highest scores a screen appears asking the Player to put their name. The Player Name and Score then gets recorded in the Highest Scores Screen. 
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy playing this game!
