1.0 What is Carpentry Assist?
</b>
</font>
</p>
<font color="black">        
<br>
Carpentry Assist is a set of measurement tools for your carpentry and other DIY projects to get your work done better. It contains the following:
<br><br>
1) Level: For ensuring your projects are on a perpendicular plane.<br>
2) Mini Ruler and Marker: A Mini Ruler for measuring the lengths of your projects. It comes with a Marker.<br>
3) Unit Conversions: Converts a Unit of Measurement of Length, Area, Volume, Weight to another Unit of Measurement.<br>  
4) Calculator: A basic and different yet more visually aesthetic calculator.<br>
5) Angles: Calculates the sin, cos, tan and cotangent values of an angle value.<br>
<br><br>
DETAILS:<br><br>
Level:<br>
It is similar to other digital level measurement tools used to determine a perpendicular plane. However, the App allows you to save the visual and numerical values of your level measurements.
<br><br>
1) 'Currently Loaded Level:'- Tells the name of the current level loaded. This is because the App allows the user to save level values both visually and numerically.<br>
2) 'Actual'- The actual coordinate value in either X or Y plane.<br>
3) 'Saved'- The saved coordinate value of the current level loaded.<br>
4) 'Load A Level'- Displays a list of saved level values that you can load.<br>
5) 'New Level To Save:'-The name of the level values to be saved should you want to save a level value.<br>
6) Save- Saves the current level measurements.<br> 
<br>
Mini Ruler and Marker:<br>
It is similar to other digital length/ruler measurement tools used to determine the length of an object. However, the App allows you to save the visual values of your ruler measurements.<br>
<br>
1) 'R+' and 'R-'- Adjusts the Ruler size.<br>
2) 'S+' and 'S-'- Adjusts the Marker movement size. The Marker is the little green dot inside the ruler.<br>
3) '1:', '2:', '3:', '4:', and '5:'-You save the current Marker location by pressing any of these five (5) buttons. An “X” marks indicates the currently loaded Marker value.<br>
4) '+' and '-'- Moves the Marker along the Ruler.<br>
<br>
Unit Conversions:<br><br>
Converts a Unit of Measurement of Length, Area, Volume, Weight to another Unit of Measurement.  
To use you simply enter the value to be converted then enter its unit of measurement then your desired unit of measurement conversion and the App displays the corresponding value based on your desired unit of measurement.
<br><br>
Calculator:<br><br>
It is a simple calculator with a different aesthetic. You use it like any other calculator where you enter the first numeric value then enter the operator whether it is Addition ('+'), Subtraction ('-'), Multiplication ('X') or Division ('/'). Next you enter the second numeric value. The App then displays the result of the calculation.
<br><br>
'MA'- Saves the value of the result of the calculation in memory for later use. The value in memory is displayed in the sixth line of the App screen. You can optionally enter an operator for the saved result of calculation value and the App will display the result on the seventh line.
<br><br>
Angles:<br><br>
It calculates the sin, cos, tan and cotangent value of an angle degree.
<br><br>
1) 'Select'- You select if you want to get the sin, cos, tan or cot operator.<br>
2) 'Degrees'- The degree value that you want the sin, cos, tan or cot value of.<br>
3) 'For Right Triangles'- Displays the formula for sin ('a/c'), cos ('b/c'), tan ('a/b') and cot ('b/a').
