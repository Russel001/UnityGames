About Santa's Trial Run
</b>
</font>
</p>
<font color="black">        
<br>
Santa's Trial Run is a fun game where our jolly old Santa trains in delivering goods. His minions help him by becoming obstacles and also by throwing snowballs at him to stun him and make him fail is trial run. 
<br><br>
Santa gains points by touching and drinking the chocolate cups along his route. He turns yellow when he gains an energy boost from the chocolate cup drink which also earns hims points.
<br><br>
However, his minions are there to ensure that Santa trains well. If Santa ever hits one of his minions which are the Penguin (almost in black and white color), Reindeer (almost in blue color), Elf (almost in green color) and Snowman (almost in white color) he loses several points. Santa must take special precaution against Snowman as he throws mean snowballs along Santa's path to stun him and cause him to lose points. Everytime Santa loses points he turns gray. If Santa's score reaches zero (0) he loses his trial run and the game itself. 
<br><br>
Santa automatically moves left and downward and the Player must tap the mobile screen to make him go forward and up. This is how simple it is to operate our game's hero which is Santa.
<br><br>
The Player can adjust the sound volume of the background music and the sound effects by adjusting the volume sliders (colored Red and White) located at the bottom of the screen.
<br><br>
The Current Player Points are displayed at the top left of the mobile screen and is colored Red while the All Around High Score for the previous past games (colored Yellow) is displayed also on the top left of the mobile screen.
<br><br>
The Menu/Restart button opens up the Menu Screen with the following three (3) buttons:
<br><br>
1. Title Image Button- Displays a fullblown art image of the game. 
<br><br>
2. High Scores Button- Displays the ten (10) Highest Scores in the game.
<br><br>
3. Restart Button- Restarts the game.
<br><br>
Everytime the Player exceeds one of the ten (10) highest scores a screen appears asking the Player to put their name. The Player Name and Score then gets recorded in the Highest Scores Screen and will be displayed in the next game.
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy playing this game!
