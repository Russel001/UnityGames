1.0 What is Pearl Diving Adventure?
</b>
</font>
</p>
<font color="black">
<br>
It is an underwater fun quest where you collect Pearls under the sea while avoiding Sharks and other dangerous fishes!
<br><br>
1.1 Introduction:<br>
You are a diver looking for Precious Pearls. Pearls are located randomly along the water and may be guarded by Sharks, Octopuses, Electric Eels and Jellyfishes which are also placed randomly in the water.
<br><br>
1.2 How the Diver moves along the water:<br>
Moving the Diver along the water is easy! The Diver automatically moves from left to right but will fall down the bottom of the water unless you TAP the screen. TAPPING the screen will make the Diver go up the water as it moves from left to right.
<br><br>
1.3 How to score a point:<br>
You score a point everytime you touch a Pearl. You may repeatedly touch the same Pearl to get more points. Pearls dissapear after a while so you must hurry to touch the Pearls to score points.
<br><br>
1.4 How the game ends:<br>
Along the way you will encounter dangerous Sharks, Octopuses, Electric Eels and Jellyfishes. If you touch any of these fishes the game ends. Sharks and Jellyfishes usually stay on top of the water while Octopuses and Electric Eels usually stay at the bottom of the water. It is not unusual for Pearls to be located near or on the same location as these dangerous fishes so be very careful when you try to touch the Pearls.<br><br>
You can also tap the "Restart" button located at the top left corner of the screen anytime to start the game all over again.
<br><br>
1.5 High Scores:<br>
The game automatically records high scores and displays it together with the current score.
